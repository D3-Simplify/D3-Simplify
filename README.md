# D3-Simplifier

## READ ME

D3 Simplifier is a dynamic visualization tool geared toward making graphs more accessible to developers. While D3 is the one of the most popular graphing libraries used today, the learning curve has a reputation of being steep and time-consuming.
Our team set out to find a solution to this obstacle by developing a platform that allows unfamiliar users to easily generate graphs based on user input parameters.

The graphs visually updates immediately when adjusted, as does the corresponding JavaScript code that's displayed below. 

We will be adding more graphs to the selection over time. The Bar Chart and Pie Chart are available now.
